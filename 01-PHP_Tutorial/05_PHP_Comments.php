Comments in PHP
=================

A comment in PHP code is a line that is not executed as a part of the program.
Its only purpose is to be read by someone who is looking at the code.

Comments can be used to:
------------------------
  > Let others understand your code

  > Remind yourself of what you did - Most programmers have experienced coming
    back to their own work a year or two later and having to re-figure out what
    they did. Comments can remind you of what you were thinking when you wrote
    the code

PHP supports several ways of commenting:


    &lt;?php

      // this is a single line comment

      # this is also a single line comment

      /* This
      is a multiline
      comment
      */
    ?&gt;

    </pre>

  <?php

  // this is a single line comment

  # this is also a single line comment

  /* This
      is a multiline
      comment
      */
  ?>

</body>
